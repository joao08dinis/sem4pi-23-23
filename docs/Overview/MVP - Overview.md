# MVP - Overview

## Context

**Learning Systems (LS)** intends to explore a new innovative software solution for remote learning.
the goal is to develop, in an exploratory way, a new remote learning platform called eCourse, using a minimum viable product (MVP) approach.
The platform should support the activities of the major actors of a course, mainly teachers,
students and managers.

Among several functionalities (described in the next chapter), the new platform should have
the following distinctive features:

* **Automated Exams** - The platform should support a fully automated approach for exams and evaluation. Teachers should be able to design exams using a simple and intuitive language and students should be able to take these exams and automatically have
  feedback and resulting grades after submitting them. The platform should also present dashboards about exam results both to students and teachers.


* **Shared Boards** - Boards are one of the main used tools for teaching. From the old chalk
  boards to the new connected digital boards, boards are one of the most successful teaching tool. The project aims to implement the concept of shared board, as a board that can be used to share and organize ideas and information.
