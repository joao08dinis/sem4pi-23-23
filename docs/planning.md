| US5002 - As Software Product Client, I want the team (software supplier) to prepare a presentation focusing on the following aspects: (i) results achieved; (ii) critical analysis of results and teamwork, adopting the SWOT format; (iii) evidence of applying the software engineering/development process; (iv) the deployment scenario of the solution; (v) the quality of the final product; (vi) suggestions of improvement; among others relevant aspects. It is also intended that each student present a self-assessment regarding their technical and behavioral skills before and after carrying out the integrative project. The result must be included in a table/graph containing all the elements of the group. We suggest the adoption of a simple rating scale (e.g. very weak, weak, fair, good, very good, excellent) |
